# Kanban Board with Next.js

## Introduction

I built a **Kanban Board Web Application** using **Next.js** and **Prisma**. This project represents my exploration into modern web technologies, focusing on performance, usability, and a clean development process.

## Key Features

My Kanban board project includes several core features designed to enhance user experience:

- **Task Visualization:** Users can see tasks categorized by stages like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
- **Drag and Drop:** A smooth drag-and-drop interface allows tasks to be easily moved between stages.
- **User Authentication:** While not fully implemented, there’s potential integration with Clerk.js for secure user authentication.

## Technology Stack

The project is built using a modern and robust tech stack:

- **Frontend:** Developed with **Next.js** and **React** for a seamless, responsive user interface.
- **Animations:** **Framer Motion** is used to add fluid transitions and interactions.
- **Database:** **Prisma** and MongoDB serves as the database access layer, providing a simple and powerful way to interact with the database.
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** ensures the app looks polished and is easy to style.
- **Development Tools:** **ESLint** and **TypeScript** are integrated to maintain code quality and reliability.

## Getting Started

To get up and running with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/belikedeep/kanbanBoard.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch the application locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Build for Production:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command generates an optimized build, ready for deployment.

## Conclusion

This project was an exciting opportunity to dive deeper into full-stack development, particularly with **Next.js** and **Prisma**. The combination of a sleek user interface and a powerful backend has resulted in a tool that’s both functional and user-friendly. I'm excited to continue expanding on this project, including adding user authentication and other features that can make the Kanban board even more powerful.
