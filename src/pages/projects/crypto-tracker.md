# Building a Crypto Tracker App with React and Vite

## Introduction

The world of cryptocurrency is fast-paced and ever-changing, making it essential for investors and enthusiasts to keep track of real-time prices. To address this need, I developed a **Crypto Tracker Web Application** using **React** and **Vite**. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for tracking the latest cryptocurrency prices, with potential features that could enhance its functionality even further.

## Key Features

My Crypto Tracker app includes several core features designed to improve user experience:

- **Real-Time Price Tracking:** Stay updated with the latest prices of various cryptocurrencies.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate the app effortlessly with a clean and intuitive design.
- **Potential Enhancements:** Depending on the implementation, the app could also feature:
  - **Search Functionality:** Quickly find specific cryptocurrencies.
  - **Historical Price Charts:** Visualize the price history of selected coins.
  - **Watchlist Creation:** Keep an eye on your favorite cryptocurrencies by adding them to a watchlist.

## Technology Stack

The project is built using a modern tech stack that ensures performance and scalability:

- **Frontend:** Developed with **React** and **React Router DOM** for efficient navigation.
- **Icons and Charts:** **React Feather icons** and **React Sparklines** are used for a visually appealing UI.
- **Build Tool:** **Vite** is employed for its fast build times and smooth development experience.
- **Data Fetching:** **Axios** (potential integration) could be used for making API calls to fetch real-time data.
- **Linting:** **ESLint** is used to maintain consistent code quality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Crypto Tracker app, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/belikedeep/crypto-tracker.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd crypto-tracker
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch the application locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Build for Production:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command generates an optimized build in the `dist` folder, ready for deployment.
